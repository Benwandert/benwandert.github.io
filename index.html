			<h2>About Ben</h2>
			<img id="portrait" src="./resources/images/IMG_1370.JPG" />
			<p id="bio">Ben Martin worked as a barista in the heart of Virginia for two years. His experience in the coffee business, along with nearly a decade in the food and service industry fueled a passion for hospitality and quality. As a dedicated coffee brewer, Ben has narrowed his process down to a science, and seeks to make every brew his next best cup. As an Army reservist, Ben deployed to the Middle East in 2022 and made a reputation for himself as the base barista. For Christmas and Thanksgiving overseas, he set up a make-shift coffee bar and provided free, high-quality pourovers for dozens of international service members as they celebrated the holidays.</p>
