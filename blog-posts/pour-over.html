		<h1 id="intro">The Pour Over: Intro and How-to</h1>
		<p>For most of us, brewing coffee marks the most important part of the day. It is that signature smell and taste of freshly brewed coffee that makes waking up delightful—and without the morning ritual something just doesn’t feel right. </p>

		<p>Everyone has their own preference of brewing style, and if you’re happy with the old 8-cup dripper then that’s okay! However, with the growing popularity of specialty coffee many people are ditching their machines for a more intimate and thoughtful experience.</p>

		<p>It can be intimidating to step out of your comfort zone, but this article will show you how mixing up your morning ritual can expose you to an entirely new side of coffee.</p>
	
		<p>Before you get started you will need the following items:</p>
		<ul class="indent">
			<li>V60 or Kalita with filters</li>
			<li>Fresh roasted coffee beans</li>
			<li>Burr Grinder</li>
			<li>Scale</li>
			<li>Timer</li>
			<li>Mug or caraffe</li>
			<li>Gooseneck kettle</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Introducing: The Pour Over</h2>
		<p>One of the world’s most beloved brewing styles, the pour over method is perhaps the easiest and most elegant way to make coffee. Affordable and aesthetically pleasing, the process can be can be as simple as you like. The idea is essentially the same as most other machines: steaming hot water drips over fresh grounds and travels through a filter into a pot or drinking vessel. If coffee makers can do this automatically, then what advantages are there to breaking it down by hand?</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2 id="control">Control is Key</h2>
		<p>Though automation is fast and convenient, it is also limiting. There is no single way to brew the many unique varieties of coffee that exist, yet most domestic coffee machines act as if the opposite is true. They are often one-size-fits-all; that is, unless you are willing to spend the extra cash for a more customizable machine. Fortunately, adopting the pour over method removes this limitation, and you get to save your money for more great coffee!</p>
		<br>
	
		<h2 id="brew">Let’s Brew</h2>
		<p>Here is the pour over process step-by-step:</p>
	
		<h3>Prepare</h3>
		<ol class="indent">
			<li>Fill your kettle with fresh water and start heating to a boil.</li>
			<li>Weigh out 20g of beans. This is your dose.</li>
			<li>Grind your beans to a medium to medium-fine grind size. </li>
			<li>Add paper filter to the brewer and rinse, allowing hot water to drain into your brewing vessel. This removes any paper taste and preheats all of the brewing components.</li>
			<li>Dump out rinse water and add coffee grinds to filter. Lightly tap brewer to flatten grinds.</li>
			<li>Place brewer and brew vessel together on top of the scale. Tare scale to zero grams.</li>
			<li>Set timer to zero.</li>
		</ol>
	
		<h3>Brew</h3>
		<ol class="indent">
			<li>Bloom: When ready, start timer and begin pouring water directly into the center of the coffee, slowly swirling in circles from the center to the outside. Avoid pouring water directly onto the filter.</li>
			<li>Pour a total of 60g and stop.</li>
			<li>Allow the coffee to rest for 30-45 seconds.</li>
			<li>First pour: Pour up to 200g and stop. Use the same swirling motion from the center, working your way to the outside.</li>
			<li>Second pour: In the same way, pour up to 300g and stop.</li>
			<li>Taking care of the hazardous temperatures, safely grasp the sides of pour over and give it 2-3 gentle swirls, evening out the coffee grinds as the water drains through.</li>
			<li>Decant into drinking vessel, coffee to cool slightly, and enjoy! The whole process should take around 3 minutes.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="dial-in">Dialing-in</h2>
		<p>After your first attempt you may or may not love the result. If bitterness or astringency creep in, you might need to dial-in your brew! Getting the most out of your roast means learning how each variable impacts flavor. By controlling variables like grind size, water temperature, and brew time you can discover different layers of hidden nuance. Think of it like a fun puzzle to solve and unlock flavors that reveal the coffee’s unique growing region. The reward comes when you can shock your friends with flavors that they never imagined were trapped in those tiny brown beans! </p>
		<br>
	
		<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
		<p>The factors we mentioned above—dose, grind size, water temperature, and brew time—are the most significant variables to focus on for beginners. Here is an explanation of how to use them to your advantage to achieve the best pour over coffee!</p>
	
		<p><span>Dose</span> - This is the amount of coffee used in grams. The dose combined with the weight of water used is your brew ratio. 1g of coffee for every 15g of water is a good place to start, but it is common to go all the way down to 1:18. More water = weaker.</p>
	
		<p class="indent"><span>How it affects flavor</span>- Using too much coffee can cause under-extraction and sour flavors. Using too little coffee can cause over-extraction and lead to bitterness.</p>
	
		<p><span>Grind size</span> - Finer grounds slow brew time and coarser grounds speed brew time. Imagine water pouring through rocks versus pouring through thick clay. The slower the brew, the more time your water has in contact with the coffee. The faster the brew, the less time your water has in contact with the coffee.</p>
	
		<p class="indent"><span>How it affects flavor</span> - Every coffee is unique, and there is no single grind setting to rule them all. Grinding too fine can lead to over-extraction and bitterness. Grinding too coarse can lead to under-extraction and sourness or astringency.</p>
	
		<p><span>Water temperature</span> - The average temperature for brewing coffee is between 195° and 205°, however the same principle still stands: all coffees are different. Since a higher temperatures contain higher levels of thermal energy, it extracts coffee more efficiently. Lower temperatures extract less efficiently.</p>
	
		<p class="indent"><span>How it affects flavor</span> - If you haven’t noticed the trend, here it is: there is no single temperature fit for all coffees! Too-high temperatures can cause bitterness. Too-low temperatures can cause astringency.</p>
	
		<p><span>Brew time</span> - Your brew time is determined by grind size and water temperature. Believe it or not, a higher temperature will increase the flow-rate of the water through the grounds. Additionally, two roasts brewed at the same grind size and temperatures can take different amounts of time. </p>
	
		<p class="indent"><span>How it affects flavor</span>- Longer brew times increase extraction, and can lead to bitterness. Shorter brew times can lead to under-extraction and, you guessed it, astringency!</p>
		<br>
	
		<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>By using flavor as your guide, practice brewing coffees that are perfectly balanced. When your brew is bitter and unpleasant, adjust one factor at a time to reduce that bitterness. Either lower your water temperature, or increase your grind size in small increments. You will notice the brew time get a little shorter, and the bitterness balance out to a more pleasant sweetness. The more you experiment with isolating and adjusting variables, the more you will build your tasting skills. With practice, you will be brewing the most vibrant and aromatic coffees you’ve ever had!</p>

		<h2 id="tips">Advanced Tips</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The Kalita pour over is a more forgiving brewer, and perhaps the best option for beginners. The flat-bottom helps the water filter evenly through the grounds, which is vital for achieving a balanced flavor profile. Brew in the Kalita courser than you would a V60. The Kalita is known for its incredibly sweet and full-bodied coffees.</li>
			<br>
			
			<li>The V60 is slightly more advanced to use, but offers more customization. The cone shape means that you have to take care to ensure even extraction of all the grounds through your pouring technique. Some of the most excellent coffees in the world are brewed in the iconic V60 pour over.</li>
			<br>
			
			<li>Bitterness and astringency can occur at the same time for various reasons.</li>
			<br>
		</ul>
		<ul class="indent-dbl">
			<li><span>Poor grind quality</span> - If your grinder does not produce evenly sized particles, then extracting  it evenly will be nearly impossible! Invest in a high-quality burr grinder. Hand grinders such as 1ZPresso, Timemore, or Hario can offer great quality without the price of the expensive electric parts.</li>
			<br>
			
			<li><span>Channeling</span> - This occurs when water travels through a “crack” or a “channel” in the coffee bed faster than the surrounding area. The grinds within the channel are over-extracted and bitter. Since channeling increases the overall brew time the rest of the coffee may be left under-extracted and sour. To avoid this, tap your brewer before pouring to flatten the grounds. Focus on your pouring technique so that you are pouring in careful, even circles. Finally, don’t forget to swirl the brewer after the last pour to even out the coffee bed.</li>
